Dear Dipesh / Omkar,
We have received only 5 units of item 1682854, whereas a higher quantity was expected. This shortfall is causing delays in our production schedule.
We request you to kindly arrange for the immediate delivery of the remaining quantity. We hope you understand the urgency of the matter and will take prompt action to resolve it.
Looking forward to your response.
