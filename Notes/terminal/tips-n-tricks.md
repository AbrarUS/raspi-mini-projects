## Open a folder from the Explorer pane into an already existing terminal shell in Visual Studio Code
- Type `cd` and drag and drop the folder into the terminal to automatically insert its path.
This is how it will look `cd 'd:/Projects/Raspi/raspi-mini-projects/Notes'` in the terminal.
> Don't mind `'` before and after path. Just press `enter`.
